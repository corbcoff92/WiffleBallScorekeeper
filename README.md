# Overview
This software is a console-based application that acts as a scoreboard for a game of wiffleball. It displays the possible actions to the user through the use of text-based menus. The user inputs the specific actions as they occur, and the updated state of the game is displayed through a text-based scoreboard. Other messages are also displayed at significant times, such as the end of the game.

This software was written to assist & demonstrate the learning of the basics of the Java programming language. These include the use/syntax of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions classes and data structures (specifically LinkedLists & LinkedHashMaps). 

{A link to a 4-5 minute YouTube demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, focusing on sharing what I learned about the language syntax will be provided here: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)}
