# Overview
This software is a console-based application that acts as a scoreboard for a game of wiffleball. It displays the possible actions to the user through a series of text-based menus. The user inputs the specific actions as they occur, and the updated state of the game is displayed through a text-based scoreboard. Other messages are also displayed at significant times, such as the end of the game. 

The documentation was created using Javadocs and document comments. This documentation can be found here: [Wiffleball Scorekeeper Documentation](./documentation/html/index.html)

This software was written to assist & demonstrate the learning of the fundamentals of the Java programming language. These include the use/syntax of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions classes and data structures (specifically <code>LinkedLists</code> & <code>LinkedHashMaps</code>). It also demonstrates the use of slightly more complex concepts such as inheritance using the <code>extends</code> keyword. 

{A link to a 4-5 minute YouTube demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, focusing on sharing what I learned about the language syntax will be provided here: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)}
